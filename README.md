# 📚 Tigrigna Cardano Academy

A community-powered initiative to teach blockchain, Web3, and Cardano fundamentals in Tigrigna for Eritrean and Tigrigna speaking communities across the Horn of Africa and the diaspora.

> “When people learn in their language, they build with confidence. The future of Cardano is multilingual.”

---

## 🎯 Mission

Tigrigna Cardano Academy is the **first open-source blockchain learning hub** in the Tigrigna language.  
Our goal: empower Tigrigna speakers with the tools, content, and confidence to participate in the global Web3 economy.

| 🗣 Glossary & Docs      | Web3 and Cardano terms translated and explained in Tigrigna                |

## 📌 Why It Matters

- 🌍 7M+ Tigrigna speakers have **zero** access to Cardano content in their language
- 📱 High mobile usage, but **low tech onboarding** due to language and literacy barriers
- 🇪🇷 Eritrean diaspora is rising in Web3 — but lacks trusted educational resources
- 🧠 Language inclusion = more developers, more voters, more dApps
